I am 20 years old. This is my 2nd year of computer engineering. 

I acknowledge that I have fully read and understood the contents of the course website; 
I will not share my work (not even a part of it)on Piazza; I will be responsible for
what has been discussed/asked on Piazza; I will not expect any response for my questions
that have already been asked or written in a language other than English. I understand that
if I have any questions or concerns about the course mechanics, it is my responsibilty to
discuss them with the instructors within their office hours.
